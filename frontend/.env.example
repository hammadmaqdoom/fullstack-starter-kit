# Notes
# ===================================
# 1. NEVER commit .env.local file to version control
# 2. The frontend does NOT connect to a database directly
# 3. All data is fetched from the backend API
# 4. Authentication is handled entirely by the backend
# 5. Session cookies are managed automatically by Better Auth
# 6. Only NEXT_PUBLIC_* variables are exposed to the browser
# 7. Server-side only variables (without NEXT_PUBLIC_) are only available in server components and API routes
# 8. For production, use environment variables in your hosting platform (Vercel, Netlify, etc.)
# 9. Optional services (PostHog, Sentry, Arcjet, Logtail) can be left empty for development
# 10. Make sure backend is running before starting the frontend
