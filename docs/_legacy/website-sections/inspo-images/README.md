### Capture Multiple Examples
For each section, save 2-4 different examples:
- One that shows the overall layout
- One that shows details (hover states, effects)
- One that shows mobile behavior (if relevant)

### High Quality Screenshots
- Use browser extensions like "Full Page Screen Capture"
- Capture at high resolution (Retina/2x if possible)
- Make sure text is readable in the screenshot

### Annotate If Needed
If you can only show part of what you like:
- Use a screenshot tool to add arrows/highlights
- Or just explain in the section spec file
