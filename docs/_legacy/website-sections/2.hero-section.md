## Animations / Effects

### On Page Load
**Animation**: [describe entrance animation]  
**Timing**: [duration and delay]

Example:
```
Text fade-up animation:
- Headline fades in from below (40px offset)
- Duration: 600ms, starts immediately
- Easing: ease-out
- Sub-headline follows 100ms after
- Buttons follow 200ms after that

3D model entrance:
- Fades in opacity 0 → 1
- Scales from 0.8 → 1
- Duration: 800ms, starts after 200ms delay
```

### Hover/Interactive
**Effect**: [what happens on interaction]

Example:
```
CTA Button hover:
- Scale to 1.05
- Cyan glow increases (0 → 0 0 20px rgba(1, 255, 255, 0.5))
- Duration: 200ms

3D model interaction:
- User can click and drag to rotate
- Rotation is smooth with momentum
- Returns to default position after 3s of no interaction
```

### Scroll Behavior (optional)
**Parallax**: [if elements move at different speeds]

Example:
```
As user scrolls down:
- 3D model parallaxes at 0.5x speed (slower than scroll)
- Background particles at 0.3x speed
- Text stays fixed until scroll past section
```

## Responsive Behavior

### Desktop (> 1024px)
- [Layout description]

### Tablet (768px - 1024px)
- [How layout adapts]

### Mobile (< 768px)
- [How layout stacks]

Example:
```
Desktop (>1024px):
- Side-by-side layout (40/60 split)
- 3D model full size

Tablet (768-1024px):
- Still side-by-side but closer to 50/50
- 3D model slightly smaller
- Font sizes reduced 15%

Mobile (<768px):
- Stack vertically: Text on top, visual below
- Text centered
- 3D model height reduced to 50vh
- Headline: 32px
- Remove parallax (performance)
```

---

## Accessibility

- [ ] Headline is H1 tag (semantic)
- [ ] Sufficient color contrast (WCAG AA)
- [ ] Buttons have proper aria-labels
- [ ] 3D elements don't cause motion sickness (can be paused)
- [ ] Text is readable at all breakpoints

---

## Design Instructions

<!-- Any additional specific requirements -->

[Your notes]

Example:
```
- The 3D model should feel premium but not overwhelming
- Keep the colorful marble base VISIBLE - don't hide it with dark overlays
- Text should have enough contrast to be readable over background
- CTA buttons must be immediately obvious (use glow effect)
- On mobile, prioritize readability over fancy effects
- Reduce animations if user prefers-reduced-motion
```

## Code References

<!-- Paste any specific code you want AI to reference -->

### Three.js Setup (if applicable)
```tsx
// Example: Basic Three.js scene setup
import * as THREE from 'three';
import { GLTFLoader } from 'three/examples/jsm/loaders/GLTFLoader';

// [Paste your Three.js code or installation instructions from 21st.dev]
```
