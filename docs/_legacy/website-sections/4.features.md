Gap: 32px between cards
```

[Distinct card backgrounds, clear separation]

### Style B: Minimal / No Cards
[Icons and text on page background, subtle separators]

### Style C: Bordered Cards Only
[Outline only, no background fill]

**Your choice**: [A / B / C / other]

## Accessibility

- [ ] Icons have proper aria-labels
- [ ] Sufficient color contrast for all text
- [ ] Cards are keyboard navigable (if interactive)
- [ ] Semantic HTML (section, headings)
- [ ] Focus states visible

---

## Design Instructions

[Specific notes]

Example:
```
- Each card should feel like a distinct feature, not blend together
- Icons should use primary color consistently
- Hover effects should be subtle, not distracting
- Description text should be concise (max 2 sentences per feature)
- If a feature is more important, consider making its card larger
- Maintain consistent icon visual weight (similar stroke thickness)
- Cards should feel interactive even if they don't navigate anywhere
```

---

## Optional: Feature Detail Expansion

**If features expand on click**:
- [ ] Modal overlay with details
- [ ] Accordion expansion inline
- [ ] Navigate to separate page
- [ ] None (static display)

**Details**: [describe expanded state]
