## Design Instructions

[Specific notes]

Example:
```
- Make the featured tier OBVIOUSLY the best choice visually
- Keep feature lists concise (max 8-10 items per tier)
- If a feature is available in all tiers, consider not repeating it
- Price should be the most prominent element in each card
- Ensure CTA buttons are clearly labeled (user knows what happens)
- For Enterprise tier, "Contact Sales" is acceptable (no price shown)
- Annual savings should be clearly visible to encourage that option
- Consider showing "per seat" pricing if relevant
```
