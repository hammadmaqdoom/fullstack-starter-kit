## Layout Structure

### Overall Container
**Width**: [contained / full-width]  
**Background**: [color or transparent]  
**Padding**: [vertical and horizontal]

Example:
```

### Steps Layout
**Pattern**:
- [ ] Horizontal timeline (3 columns, steps left-to-right)

- [ ] Alternating (step 1 left, step 2 right, etc.)
- [ ] Other: [describe]

**Connection between steps**:
- [ ] Dotted/solid line
- [ ] Arrow
- [ ] None
- [ ] Animated gradient line

Example:
```
Layout: Horizontal timeline on desktop, vertical on mobile
Steps: 3 equal-width columns with connecting line
Connection: Gradient line (cyan to purple) between step numbers
Line style: 2px solid with gradient
```

## Step Component Design

### Number/Icon Container
**Shape**: [circle / square / hexagon / none]  
**Size**: [e.g., "80px diameter"]  
**Background**: [color / gradient]  
**Border**: [if any]

Example:
```
Number container:
- Shape: Circle
- Size: 72px diameter

**Padding**: [spacing]  
**Border**: [if any]

Example:
```
Step container:

```

OR

```
Step card:
- Background: rgba(26,26,26,0.5)
- Border: 1px solid rgba(255,255,255,0.1)
- Border radius: 16px
- Padding: 32px
- Hover: Subtle lift and glow
```

### Typography

**Step Description**:
- Font size: [e.g., "16px"]
- Font weight: [e.g., "400"]
- Color: [hex code]
- Line height: [e.g., "1.6"]

**Spacing**:
- Number → Title: [e.g., "24px"]
- Title → Description: [e.g., "12px"]

## Connecting Line/Path

### Style
**Type**: [straight line / curved / stepped]  
**Color**: [solid color / gradient]  
**Width**: [e.g., "2px"]  
**Pattern**: [solid / dashed / dotted]

Example:
```
Connecting line:
- Runs horizontally between step numbers
- Gradient: Linear from cyan (#01FFFF) to purple (#A855F7)
- Width: 2px
- Style: Solid
- Positioned: Connects center of each number circle
```

### Animation (optional)
- [ ] Draws in on scroll
- [ ] Pulses/glows
- [ ] Gradient moves along line
- [ ] Static

Example:
```
Line animation:
- Draws from left to right when section enters viewport
- Duration: 1.2s ease-in-out
- Followed by step content fading in sequentially
```

## Visual Elements (Screenshots/Illustrations)

### If Using Visuals for Each Step
**Format**: [screenshot / illustration / icon / none]  
**Size**: [dimensions or aspect ratio]  
**Position**: [above text / beside text / below text]

Example:
```
Visuals: UI screenshots showing each step
Size: 16:9 aspect ratio, max 400px wide
Position: Above title in each step
Border: 1px solid with subtle shadow
Effect: Subtle hover scale (1.02)
```

---

## Animations

### On Scroll Into View
**Sequence**: [describe reveal animation]

Example:
```
Animation sequence when section enters view:
1. Connecting line draws across (1.2s)
2. Step 1 fades in + slides up (0.5s)
3. Step 2 fades in + slides up (0.5s, delayed 0.2s)
4. Step 3 fades in + slides up (0.5s, delayed 0.4s)
Easing: ease-out
```

### Hover/Interactive
**Effect**: [if steps are interactive]

Example:
```
Step hover:
- Number circle gets brighter border
- Slight scale on number (1.05)
- Description text color brightens
- Transition: 200ms
```

---

## Mobile Behavior

### Mobile (< 768px)
**Layout**: [how steps stack]  
**Connection**: [vertical line / none]

Example:
```
Mobile:
- Vertical stack (single column)
- Connection: Vertical line on left side connecting all numbers
- Number size: 56px (smaller)
- Step padding: 20px
- Title: 20px (down from 24px)
- Spacing between steps: 48px
```

## Alternative Layouts

### Vertical Timeline (Alternative)
[If you prefer vertical over horizontal]

### Bento Grid

[If steps are interactive/clickable to see more detail]

**Your choice**: [describe which layout]

---

## Call-to-Action (Optional)

**If section ends with CTA**:
- Text: [e.g., "Ready to get started?"]
- Button: [e.g., "Start Free Trial"]
- Placement: [below steps / integrated]

---

## Accessibility

- [ ] Semantic ordered list (`<ol>`) for steps
- [ ] Sufficient contrast for text
- [ ] Step numbers are part of accessible content
- [ ] Animations respect prefers-reduced-motion
- [ ] Connection line is decorative (aria-hidden)

---

## Design Instructions

[Specific notes]

Example:
```
- Keep steps concise - users should grasp the process quickly
- Each step should feel equally important (equal visual weight)
- If using screenshots, ensure they're high quality and relevant
- Connection line should be subtle, not dominating
- On mobile, maintain clear hierarchy despite vertical layout
- Number circles should be the visual anchor for each step
- Consider adding subtle icon inside number circle
```

- [ ] Click to expand full details
- [ ] Hover to preview
- [ ] All details visible by default
- [ ] Modal on click

**Details**: [describe expansion behavior]
