- Buttons get cyan glow (0 0 20px rgba(1, 255, 255, 0.4))
- Links get underline with 200ms fade-in
```

### Shadows & Glows

## Component Style Patterns

<!-- General patterns for how components should look -->

### Buttons
**Style**: [pill-shaped, square, rounded, etc.]  
**Effects**: [solid, gradient, outline, glass, etc.]

Example:
```
Primary Button:
- Style: Pill-shaped (border-radius: 999px)
- Background: Gradient (cyan to darker cyan)
- Hover: Slight glow + scale to 1.05
- Text: White, 16px, semibold
```

### Cards
**Style**: [describe]  
**Background**: [color/transparency]  
**Border**: [if any]

Example:
```
Cards:
- Background: Dark gray (#1A1A1A) with subtle transparency
- Border: 1px solid #333
- Border radius: 16px
- Hover: Lift up 4px + cyan glow on border
```

### Input Fields
**Style**: [describe]

## Animation Philosophy

<!-- How should things move? Fast? Smooth? Subtle? -->

**Speed**: [e.g., "Fast (200-300ms)", "Smooth (400-500ms)", "Slow/dramatic (800ms+)"]  
**Easing**: [e.g., "ease-in-out", "cubic-bezier(...)"]  
**Principles**: [e.g., "Subtle, never distracting", "Playful and bouncy"]

Example:
```
Animations:
- Speed: Fast and snappy (200-300ms)
- Easing: ease-in-out for most, ease-out for entrances
- Philosophy: Subtle and professional. Never distract from content.
              Hover effects should feel responsive, not sluggish.
```

## Special Notes

<!-- Any other design considerations or constraints -->

[Your notes here]

Examples:
- "Avoid red entirely - conflicts with brand"
- "Keep animations minimal for accessibility"
- "Must look premium without being overly complex"
