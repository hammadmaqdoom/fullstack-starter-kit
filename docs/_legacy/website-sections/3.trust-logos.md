## Accessibility

- [ ] Logos have alt text with company names

- [ ] Section has semantic heading (if headline exists)
- [ ] Sufficient contrast for any text

---

## Design Instructions

[Specific notes]

Example:
```
- Keep this section subtle - it's supporting proof, not the main focus
- Logos should not overpower other content
- Maintain equal visual weight across all logos (despite different shapes)
- If a logo is too complex, use simplified version
- Grayscale maintains professional, unified look
- Don't make logos clickable unless specifically requested
```
