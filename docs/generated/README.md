# Generated Documentation

This folder contains **AI-generated documentation** based on your requirements specifications.

## 🤖 What Goes Here

AI will generate these files from your specifications:

1. **TECHNICAL_DOCS.md** - Consolidated technical documentation
2. **DATABASE_SCHEMA.sql** - Generated database schema and migrations
3. **API_CONTRACTS.yaml** - OpenAPI/Swagger specification
4. **tasks.md** - Build checklist with tasks and checkboxes

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Do Not Edit Manually

These files are **generated by AI** from your requirements. If you need to make changes:

1. Update the source requirements in `../project-requirements/`
2. Regenerate the documentation using AI prompts
3. Don't manually edit generated files (changes will be overwritten)

### Version Control

- **Do commit**: Generated files should be committed to git
- **Why**: Team members can see the current state without regenerating
- **Update**: Regenerate when requirements change

### Regeneration

When to regenerate:
- ✅ After updating requirements documents
- ✅ After changing database design
- ✅ After modifying API specifications
- ✅ Before starting implementation

## 🚀 How to Generate

### Using AI Prompts

See `../PROMPTS.md` for exact prompts to use.

**Example workflow**:

1. **Complete all requirements** in `../project-requirements/`
2. **Use Prompt 1**: "Generate technical documentation"
   - AI creates `TECHNICAL_DOCS.md`
3. **Use Prompt 2**: "Generate database schema"
   - AI creates `DATABASE_SCHEMA.sql`
4. **Use Prompt 3**: "Generate API contracts"
   - AI creates `API_CONTRACTS.yaml`
5. **Use Prompt 4**: "Generate build checklist"
   - AI creates `tasks.md`

### Example Prompt

```
Based on all my requirements in docs/project-requirements/, 
generate a complete DATABASE_SCHEMA.sql file that includes:

- All table definitions
- Indexes for performance
- Foreign key constraints
- Check constraints
- Seed data for roles and initial setup
- Comments explaining each table

Use PostgreSQL syntax.
```

## 🔄 Regeneration Workflow

When requirements change:

```
1. Update requirements documents
   ↓
2. Review changes
   ↓
3. Regenerate affected files
   ↓
4. Review generated output
   ↓
5. Commit to git
   ↓
6. Update implementation if needed
```

## 💡 Tips

### 1. Review Generated Files

Always review AI-generated files:
- Check for accuracy
- Verify completeness
- Test SQL syntax
- Validate API contracts

### 2. Keep in Sync

Generated files should match requirements:
- If requirements change, regenerate
- Don't let generated files drift
- Use as source of truth for implementation

### 3. Use for Onboarding

Generated documentation is great for:
- New team members
- Contractors
- Code reviews
- Technical interviews

### 4. Automate If Possible

Consider automating generation:
- Git hooks
- CI/CD pipeline
- Pre-commit checks
