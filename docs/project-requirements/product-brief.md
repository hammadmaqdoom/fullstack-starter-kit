# Product Brief

> **INSTRUCTIONS**: Fill out this template completely before building anything. This is your foundation document that explains WHAT you're building and WHY. Works for any project type: websites, APIs, SaaS apps, mobile backends, etc.

---

## Project Overview

### What are you building?

<!-- In 2-3 paragraphs, describe your product/project. What problem does it solve? What makes it unique? -->

[Your description here]

**Example (SaaS Application)**:
"Guardian AI is a security platform that helps development teams find vulnerabilities in their code before deployment. Unlike traditional security tools that only scan for known issues, Guardian uses AI to predict potential security risks based on code patterns and suggest fixes in real-time."

**Example (API Service)**:
"PaymentHub API is a unified payment processing service that aggregates multiple payment providers (Stripe, PayPal, Square) behind a single API. Developers integrate once and can switch providers or use multiple providers without changing code."

**Example (Website)**:
"TechConf 2026 is an annual developer conference website showcasing speakers, schedule, and ticket sales. The site needs to handle high traffic during ticket launches and provide a seamless registration experience."
